## üìñ Project Overview
The Spotify Dashboard is an interactive data visualization tool created using Power BI to analyze user engagement and streaming behavior on Spotify. This dashboard aims to provide valuable insights into listening habits, popular tracks, albums, and artists, helping users better understand trends and patterns over time. By visualizing metrics like total albums played, most-streamed tracks, user preferences across platforms (desktop, mobile, smart speakers), and listening habits on weekdays vs weekends, the dashboard enables users to identify shifts in engagement and optimize content strategies. This project makes use of Spotify streaming data, sourced from a Kaggle dataset, to track listening behavior on an individual and aggregated level. The goal is to demonstrate how data visualization can provide actionable insights into music consumption, improving decisions related to marketing campaigns, content creation, and user experience.
